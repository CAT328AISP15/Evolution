# Evolution

Create a simple sketch, that exhibitions evolution. Customize your genetic algorithm.

- Parameters: population size & mutation rate
- What is your genotype (data) & phenotype (physical manifestation)? Remember this could be anything, from how your agent moves, behaviors/capabilities, physical characteristics, level design, etc
- What is your fitness function? Remember exponential is better than linear.

1. Start with your population
2. Selection: What is your fitness function?
3. Reproduction - crossover & mutation
4. Replace the old population with the new, passing on the new genes.
